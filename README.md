# Match-the-hidden-Emojis
Match The Hidden Emojis - memory game with a point system, limited moves, bonuses, and leaderboards; it has something in common with Memory Match, Mahjong, and Candy Crush

The game is a memory and logic challenge where every move counts.
The game board consists of a 10 × 10 grid — 100 hidden tiles in total.
Behind each tile hides one of 50 different images or symbols, each appearing twice.
Click on tiles to reveal them two at a time:
If the two revealed tiles match, they remain open, and you earn points.
If they don’t match, both tiles flip back, and you can try again.
Your goal is to uncover all matching pairs as efficiently as possible — with limited moves and within the best possible time.

Scoring...
When match your first pair, you earn +10 points.
Each consecutive successful match in a row gives an increasing reward:
1st match → +10 points / 2nd match → +20 points / 3rd match → +30 points / 4th match → +40 points / 5th match → +50 points ...and so on...

If your streak breaks (you reveal two different tiles), the multiplier resets.
Each game starts with a limit of 250 moves.
You can buy +10 extra moves for 20 points.

New players receive a welcome bonus of 100 points after registration.
Each time you log in, you earn an additional +10 daily bonus points — up to 2 times per day.

Leaderboard & Statistics...
...total accumulated points, total playtime, total games, and average scores... etc.

Match quickly and accurately — speed and precision matter!
Build long streaks of successful matches to maximize the score.
Manage your moves carefully and decide wisely when to buy extra ones.
